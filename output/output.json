Mostly recorded in the United Kingdom, the album was rap music's first double-vinyl LP release; it was also issued as a single cassette and CD. \"Parents Just Don't Understand\", the lead-off single, made them MTV household names and also gained the honor of the first Grammy for a hip hop/rap song, which was met with mixed feelings. Nevertheless, the single was a success, launching the group into even more mainstream stardom. The video showed Prince's misadventures of trying to get around his parents' strict rules in a very comical way, very much like their first single \"Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble\". It gained much airplay on TV channels such as MTV, giving the group much attention. The song was played in an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (\"Someday Your Prince Will Be In Effect (Part 1)\"), and referenced in two other episodes of the same series (\"The Fresh Prince Project\" and \"Not With My Pig, You Don't\").  Another single, \"Nightmare on My Street\", showcased a fictional confrontation with movie villain Freddy Krueger. Coinciding with the release of the fourth Nightmare on Elm Street film (1988's The Dream Master); New Line Cinema was not pleased. A video allegedly shot for the single was buried, and a disclaimer was hastily included on pressings of the album indicating that the record was not officially affiliated with any of the Nightmare films. (Ironically, Jive Records ended up releasing the soundtrack to the next film in the series, The Dream Child.) After this success, in 1988 the lead singles from Rock the House, including \"Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble\", were re-released and changed a bit from their original 1985 release, with the outro referencing singles \"Nightmare on My Street\" and \"Parents Just Don't Understand\":  Jeff: Man, first your parents just don't understand.Will: Word, I know, man.Jeff: Then you have these crazy nightmares.Will: Why me? Why me?  Jeff reveals on track 19 of Skillz's Infamous Quotes mixtape that New Line Cinema approached Will & Jeff for a movie role which they ended up turning down. The film was House Party. The last single from He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper was \"Brand New Funk\" sampled a James Brown song and quotes it. In the song, the Fresh Prince explains how Jeff has brought in a tape that contains a very cool song that he cannot help but rap over, and how fans react to it. The song was well received by many hip hop fans due to its funk sound, lyrical spins, and the fact that it showed off more of the skills of Jazzy Jeff. The video was shot in black and white, showed live performance clips from a concert and featured 2 Damn Hype Dancing.\n\nAnswer this question \"What happened in 1988\" by extracting the answer from the text above.

This Soft Modern style was initially taken up at Whitefriars by designer James Hogan, just before the war, and then after it by chief designer and managing director William Wilson. When Baxter joined much of his initial output, in the form of coloured (often two-tone) cased and mould-blown pieces, displayed the smooth, clean, organic lines characteristic of contemporary Scandinavian design. However, during the 1960s he began to develop his own highly distinctive style.\n\nAs before, nature provided much of the inspiration, but now organic texture rather than organic shape became the focus. Baxter experimented with numerous methods of producing texture \u2013 including lining the glass moulds with materials as diverse as tree bark, bricks, copper wire, and nail heads \u2013 and most proved highly effective, as the illustrated examples reveal.\n\nThey also convey Baxter\u2019s equally distinctive use of colour. You should note that some colours are more desirable to current collectors than others. For example, as a rule-of-thumb Tangerine commands a quarter to a third the price of, Aubergine and Pewter about half the price of, the greenish-grey coloured Willow, while pale green Meadow or vibrant Kingfisher blue will cost, in an equivalent vessel, about twice as much. However, all encapsulate not only Baxter\u2019s individual style, but also much of the spirit of the vibrant, dynamic, pop-and-rock driven Swinging Sixties and early Seventies.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, however, just texture and colour that defined Baxter\u2019s style and captured the essence of the time. A third element, and the one that does most to distinguish him from his Scandinavian contemporaries, is his use of form: shapes such as Banjo, Totem, TV, Coffin, Nuts & Bolts and, above all, the amusingly asymmetrical and now iconic Drunken Bricklayer, are not only significantly less austere, more geometric, more urban, and far quirkier than their Scandinavian counterparts, they are also in these respects quintessentially British.\nWhat is a short summary of the above article?

In the Najaf desert south of Baghdad, one group of volunteers were seen jumping through pits of fire and hurling themselves from sand dunes as part of the training. Scroll down for video. A group of Shiite men crawl through sand in the Najaf desert, south of Baghdad, after joining the Iraqi Military. The men are among hundreds who  joined the military after clerics pleaded for worshippers to volunteer. The men are among hundreds to have signed up to the military after answering a plea from Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric last year. In June, grand ayatollah Ali al-Sistani pleaded with youngsters to volunteer their services in the wake of crippling attacks against the religion by ISIS fighters. Hundreds flocked to military centres across Baghdad, with Iraqi Army officials confident the boost in soldiers would help regain crucial swathes of territory. Since then extremists have faced increased opposition, fighting off Kurdish militias as well as the the army all the while under the threat of airstrike by US and UK led coalitions. Over the weekend 26 strikes were carried out across Iraq and eight in Syria by US forces as part of the ongoing campaign. Mosul, the country's second largest city and an ISIS stronghold, is primed for retaking, it was claimed earlier this week, with residents exasperated with life under the rule of fanatics. According to the former mayor of the neighbouring town of Tel Afar, civilians are 'ready' to join the Iraqi Army in its campaign to take back control of the city. ISIS militants are thought to control around a third of Iraq despite a sustained campaign of airstrikes against fanatics. The Shiite men join hundreds on the front line battling against fanatics, with Kurdish forces in the north also waging war against ISIS militants. Last year Iraqi Army officials said an increase in the number of men signing up to the army would help the country in its fight against terror. In Sinjar, one of the most heated patches of conflict, Kurdish forces fought off extremists' unrelenting gunfire and strikes after months of battle. The town's Yazidi population was all but obliterated last year in a humanitarian crisis which prompted UN intervention. While IS fighters have been driven out of the region, Kurdish troops remain under the threat of sniper fire, experts have warned. In Syria however, militiamen and women were filmed celebrating after defeating ISIS militants in the fight for Kobane. Fighters speaking on behalf of extremists admitted they had been overpowered by Kurdish forces following months of bloodshed. It is the latest in a string of blows to the fanatical regime which has also murdered Western and Japanese journalists and aid workers in the past year. ISIS has lost control of crucial swathes of territory including Kobane in Syria. Above, a fanatic waves the group's flag through the streets of Raqqa in Syria.

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a $42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \"paying full annual registration fees.\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between $700,000 and $1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\" Schmitt said. \"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. \n\nQuestion: \"Why does the Illinois Supreme Court want to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers?\"\n\nAnswer: \"They want to increase the rates to give services to the poor and to help lawyers with drug and alcohol problems\"\n\nBased on the paragraph, is this answer correct [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281633.2095556, "end": 1703281648.6151707, "TT_ack": 13.881206512451172, "TTFT": 247.2062110900879, "TPOT": 27.782913149479064, "response_time": 15.405615091323853, "output_tokens": 555, "worker_id": 1, "input_tokens": 164, "response_string": "\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n", "input_string": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an AI assistant.

The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\". Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking.\"?\n [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281639.3819988, "end": 1703281646.0775523, "TT_ack": 16.496896743774414, "TTFT": 292.87075996398926, "TPOT": 27.829402685165405, "response_time": 6.695553541183472, "output_tokens": 241, "worker_id": 2, "input_tokens": 109, "response_string": "\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an AI assistant.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  and the situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.

Today I\u2019m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It\u2019s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque\u2019s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it\u2019s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn\u2019t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel. At the end of the story the narrator probably felt  A. Better about Temple spa products  B. Better about wedding fairs.  C. not enough information  D. Worse about Temple spa products\nA: [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281632.475546, "end": 1703281636.8742256, "TT_ack": 12.923955917358398, "TTFT": 406.5532684326172, "TPOT": 29.835073315367406, "response_time": 4.398679733276367, "output_tokens": 148, "worker_id": 4, "input_tokens": 112, "response_string": "\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/", "input_string": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an AI assistant.

In the early 1990s, Arthur relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, continuing to record home demos, playing local clubs and working as a guitar salesman at Clark Music Store.  In 1996, Peter Gabriel's A&R associate Harvey Schartz presented Gabriel with a demo of Arthur's first EP, Cut and Blind. Gabriel and Schwartz arranged a live audition at The Fez nightclub in New York City, and Arthur flew up from Atlanta. The night was a success; not only was Lou Reed a guest in the audience, but within a few months Arthur was officially signed, making him the first American recording artist signed to Gabriel's label. Arthur recorded his debut album at Gabriel's Real World Studios in England with producer Markus Dravs (Bjork, Coldplay, Arcade Fire). The debut album Big City Secrets was released worldwide in spring 1997, and Arthur joined Gabriel's WOMAD tour in Europe. Big City Secrets displayed Arthur's often angsty and emotionally wrought lyrics coupled with diverse instrumentation, which he himself described as \"someone struggling to heal over experimental folk-rock\", but went virtually unnoticed by the mainstream. Two years later, he recorded an EP called Vacancy, which earned him a Grammy nomination in 2000 for best recording package.\n\nDid the album reach the charts?

Big-time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again, I was all for it from the start. That is, until I watched some episodes... Oh boy, it's really bad TV. Not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits, but there seems to be guidelines as well, like shooting in HD for example. To make a long story short, it's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons. I cannot help but compare to the \"Tales From The Crypt\", and the M.o.H. episodes really don't stand the comparison. TFTC was good, MOH is bad; according to me here are a few keys to explain it: TFTC was shorter (around 25 minutes for each episode) than MOH (50 minutes per episode), I believe it allowed denser screenplays, with good ideas reoccurring more often, better overview of an episode, less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring. Duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on TFTC: directors got to have REAL film music composers (composers on MOH are if inexistent, very bad), REAL actors (whereas on MOH it's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor!), REAL directors of photography and, it can help sometimes, REAL film cameras (while MOH is shot on HD cameras with very wrongly chosen lens-pieces), the result of which being that the episodes of TFTC looked and felt \"cinematographic\" in the sense that there was real actors being casted, ranging from Michael J. Fox to Tim Roth to Kyle McLachlan to Kirk Douglas, but there were also film composers behind it, of the range of Alan Silvestri, great directors of photography like Dean Cundey, high-end screenplay writers, and in that sense each \"Tale\" was a little movie of its own true kind. Compared to TFTC, the \"Masters of Horrors\" is quite a lame approach to TV horror. It's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average, because it looks the same as any ugly TV serial, if not worse. It gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast, within the first 10 minutes usually. The actors are never-heard before wannabes (except for Fairuza Balk, Robert Englund, Angela Bettis and a few, but even there, they are the only famous actors of their episodes). The director base for MoH was good in the beginning, but it's getting worst and worst with every episode: now if even the directors are unknown to the world, what remains? Nothing! And it's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they haven't even had, say, Stan Winston, Dick Maas, William Lustig, Sam Raimi, Eric Red, Robert Harmon, William Friedkin, Jim Muro, Stuart Gordon, Russell Mulcahy... If even \"Masters of Horror\" cannot bring dead directors back to life, who will? Maybe a rerun of Tales from the Crypt will.\nWould you say this review is positive or negative?\nChoose from:\n1). negative\n2). positive [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281635.2437797, "end": 1703281650.474368, "TT_ack": 15.199899673461914, "TTFT": 521.449089050293, "TPOT": 28.228921217909548, "response_time": 15.230588436126709, "output_tokens": 540, "worker_id": 5, "input_tokens": 915, "response_string": "\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>\n\nYou are an AI assistant.

She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14). She is the only female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\nAsada moved from Japan to the United States in August 2006 to train with Rafael Arutyunyan in Lake Arrowhead, California. There she was able to escape the overcrowding of Japanese rinks and the pressure of the Japanese media.  At her first event, the 2006 Skate America, Asada won the bronze medal behind Miki Ando and Kimmie Meissner. Asada had won the short program, but was fourth in the free skating, finishing with a total score 171.23 points. She was 21.36 points out of first place. Asada won her second event, the 2006 NHK Trophy with 199.52 points, setting the highest combined score in a Ladies' competition under the ISU Judging System and consequently, a world record. Her margin of victory was 20.21 points ahead of silver medalist Fumie Suguri. Asada went into the 2006-07 Grand Prix Final as the reigning champion. She placed second with 172.52 points, 11.68 behind gold medalist Yuna Kim. Asada had won the short program, but placed fourth in the free skating.  Asada won the 2006-07 Japan Championships by 26.11 points ahead of silver medalist Miki Ando. At the 2007 Worlds Championships, Asada was fifth in the short program, 10.03 points behind Yuna Kim, who placed first in that section of the competition with a score of 71.95 points, setting a new world record for the highest short program score. Asada won the free skating with a score of 133.13 points, setting a new world record for the highest free skating score, a record which stood for eight months. During her free skating, she successfully landed a triple axel, a triple flip-triple loop combination, a double axel, a triple lutz, a triple flip, and a triple lutz-double loop-double loop combination but under-rotated the second jump of a double axel-triple toe loop combination. She won the silver medal at her first Senior World Championships appearance, earning an overall of 194.95 points, 0.64 behind gold medalist Miki Ando and 8.31 ahead of Yuna Kim, who won the bronze.\n\nAsk a question about this article.

In his right hand I saw what I call a meat cleaver or a machete.\n\n\u201cI instantly thought, 'He\u2019s going to kill me\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe force of E48\u2019s shot threw Adebolajo to the ground and the three officers then leapt out of the car and saw Adebowale, who was holding a gun.\n\nD49 said: \u201cI thought, 'Oh my God he\u2019s going to shoot me\u2019. I feared for my life.\u201d The third officer then shot Adebowale but the attacker raised his gun while lying on the ground.\n\nE48 told the jury: \u201cI\u2019ve still got a distinct image in my mind of him holding a black revolver in his hand which I clearly saw, which struck me as unusual because he\u2019d just been shot.\u201d\n\nPolice fired again at the hand holding the gun and shot Adebowale\u2019s thumb off.\n\nThe officers then immediately administered first aid, said E48, adding: \u201cOnce the threat is neutralised we have a duty of care to all persons to save life, no matter who they are.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the court was shown a video clip of Adebolajo telling members of the public he had attacked Fusilier Rigby in retaliation for British soldiers killing Muslims. He then told paramedic Nicholas Goh: \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to die, I just want the soldiers out of my country.\u201d.\n\nAdebolajo also told him he wished the bullets had killed him, Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, said.\n\nIn a statement, Stephen Berry, another paramedic, said Adebolajo told him that \u201cBritish soldiers deserved to die\u201d for raping and killing women \u201cin our lands\u201d.\n\nThe defendant later told Pc Melita Vejnovic in hospital that he had never intended to hurt civilians, only the military.\n\nMichelle Nimmo, a witness, said in a statement that one of the alleged attackers had a \u201csmirk\u201d on his face and both men appeared \u201cproud\u201d of what they had done. \u201cThey stood around looking proud and posing with the gun and knives.

Article: St James's Palace has announced that while Miss Middleton will wear a wedding ring. Prince William has chosen not to.  Rings are typically exchanged by couples during their wedding to represent commitment  to each other. Does it matter if husbands don't wear a wedding ring? Prince William's father wears one, his grandfather doesn't and their decisions weren't seen as strange. But reactions to Prince William's decision show that wedding rings for husbands are now the norm. One young man, who spoke to the BBC, thinks William is setting a bad example, saying: \"I think it's disgraceful  . It's a tradition. You have to wear a ring really. And for someone of the royal family to do that, it's not right. \" Broadly speaking, modem husbands tend to wear their wedding rings as a symbol of loyalty and faithfulness. So not wearing one can seem unusual or even dishonest to some, although men haven't always worn them.  The wearing of wedding rings has been the done thing for centuries among wives but only became common practice among husbands during World War II. Men fighting overseas usually wore them as a reminder of wives and families back home.  Wearing rings is a safety issue  for men in certain manual jobs. But how does William explain his decision?

But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \"moderate\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.\nAnswer: [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281650.8094232, "end": 1703281667.6449604, "TT_ack": 12.917518615722656, "TTFT": 277.70328521728516, "TPOT": 26.66025305323291, "response_time": 16.83553719520569, "output_tokens": 632, "worker_id": 7, "input_tokens": 201, "response_string": "\n\n<</SYS>>\n\nProcess:  - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body.

Seven people, including five children under eight, have been infected with E. coli O157 from the same park in Birmingham in recent weeks. The Health Protection Agency said the likely cause was cowpats and rabbit droppings. A child who contracted E. Coli from cowpats in a field in Sutton Park in Sutton Coldfield, has been discharged from hospital and is making a recovery. The child has since been discharged from hospital and is making a recovery. The HPA said the strain of the bacteria was often associated with contact with rural environments that may have been contaminated by animal faeces. Sutton Park, in Sutton Coldfield, covers around 2,400 acres and is thought to attract around two million visitors annually. Cows are free to roam around the park - sharing space with the public. Designated a National Nature Reserve, the former royal deer park is included in English Heritage's list of historic parks and gardens, and includes sites of archaeological interest. Signs have been put up around the park to warn visitors of the risk of contracting E. coli O157 from s cowpats and rabbit droppings. HPA's Dr Roger Gajraj said: \"E. coli O157 can be very serious in young children and can in some instances cause kidney failure. \"The council is increasing hand-washing facilities at the park and the city council and HPA are issuing leaflets and displaying posters to warn visitors of the risks and advise on preventative measures. \"However to minimise the risk of infection parents may want to consider taking very young children to other parks in the local area.

E.coli outbreak which killed one and made 250 ill was kept secret for 7 months. \"The best protection against E. coli is to always wash your hands, especially after contact with animals, after going to the toilet and immediately before eating. \"I would also advise cyclists and walkers to wash their tyres, footwear and their hands after visiting Sutton Park as an extra precaution. \"If hand-washing facilities are not immediately available, alcohol-based hand wipes can provide some limited protection but they don't work or give adequate protection when hands are already soiled.\" Stuart Smith who rides his bike through Sutton Park has caught E.coli, along with his family who walk there. Darren Share, Birmingham City Council's head of parks said: \"We are working closely with the HPA to control this outbreak and we have already taken a number of measures. \"But as the infection can be particularly serious for young children we feel it is appropriate at this stage to warn parents and families of the potential risks. \"There are signs throughout the park informing visitors of the outbreak and the steps they can take to protect themselves.\"\n\nHighlights: [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281626.4603324, "end": 1703281640.898532, "TT_ack": 12.685537338256836, "TTFT": 362.0409965515137, "TPOT": 27.902348129154404, "response_time": 14.438199520111084, "output_tokens": 518, "worker_id": 8, "input_tokens": 206, "response_string": "\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an AI assistant.

Spare Parts was followed by Sound Pump in 1968, Macainsh formed Reuben Tice in Eltham, with Tony Williams on vocals. By 1970 Macainsh was back with Strauks, now on drums, first in Claptrap and by 1971 in Frame which had Graeme \"Shirley\" Strachan as lead vocalist. Frame also included Pat O'Brien on guitar and Cynthio Ooms on guitar. Strachan had befriended Strauks earlier--he sang with Strauks on the way to parties--and was asked to join Claptrap which was renamed as Frame. Strachan stayed in Frame for about 18 months but left for a career in carpentry and a hobby of surfing in Phillip Island.  Skyhooks formed in March 1973 in Melbourne with Steve Hill on vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Ingliss on guitar (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, Peter Starkie on guitar and backing vocals (Lipp & the Double Dekker Brothers) and Strauks on drums and backing vocals. The name, Skyhooks, came from a fictional organisation in the 1956 film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Their first gig was on 16 April 1973 at St Jude's Church hall in Carlton. At a later gig, former Daddy Cool frontman, Ross Wilson was playing in his group Mighty Kong with Skyhooks as a support act. Wilson was impressed with the fledgling band and signed Macainsh to a publishing deal. In August, Bob \"Bongo\" Starkie (Mary Jane Union) on guitar replaced his older brother Peter (later in Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) and Ingliss was replaced by Red Symons (Scumbag) on guitar, vocals and keyboards. The two new members added a touch of theatre and humour to the band's visual presence. By late 1973, Wilson had convinced Michael Gudinski to sign the band to his booking agency, Australian Entertainment Exchange, and eventually to Gudinski's label, Mushroom Records.  Skyhooks gained a cult following around Melbourne including university intelligentsia and pub rockers, but a poorly received show at the January 1974 Sunbury Pop Festival saw the group booed off stage. Two tracks from their live set, \"Hey What's the Matter?\" and \"Love on the Radio\" appeared on Mushroom's Highlights of Sunbury '74. After seeing his performance on TV, Hill phoned Macainsh and resigned. To replace Hill, in March, Macainsh recruited occasional singer, surfer and carpenter Strachan from his Frame era. Strachan had been dubbed \"Shirley\" by fellow surfers due to his curly blond hair a la Shirley Temple.\n\nAsk a question about this article.

The band disbanded acrimoniously in 1993, but reunited in 2004.\n\nThe Pixies are influenced by a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says he was listening to nothing but Husker Du, Captain Beefheart, and Iggy Pop; During the making of Doolittle he listened heavily to the Beatles' White Album. He has cited Buddy Holly as a model for his compressed songwriting. Francis did not discover punk rock until he was 16, saying \"it was good I didn't listen to these hip records\". As a child, he listened mainly to 1960s songs, religious music and Emerson Lake and Palmer, then Iggy Pop, Husker Du, Captain Beefheart and Talking Heads, who he says \"weren't punk either\".  Santiago listened to 1970s and 1980s punk including Black Flag, as well as David Bowie and T. Rex. Guitarists who influenced him include Jimi Hendrix, Les Paul, Wes Montgomery, and George Harrison. Deal's musical background was folk music and country; she had formed a country-folk band with her sister in her teenage years, and played covers of artists such as The Everly Brothers and Hank Williams. Other artists Deal listened to included XTC, Gang of Four and Elvis Costello. Lovering is a fan of the band Rush.  Other media such as film has influenced the Pixies; Francis cites surrealist films Eraserhead and Un chien andalou (as mentioned in \"Debaser\") as influences. He has commented on these influences, saying he \"didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels\", but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What type of music influenced them?

If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: The Invasion Context: An alien lifeform, much like a fungus or spore, clings to the space shuttle Patriot as it crashes back to Earth, spreading tainted debris from Texas to Washington, D.C. Curious onlookers steal, touch and even sell the parts on eBay, much like what happened with the Columbia disaster. This in turn infects many people, robbing them of their emotions when they enter REM sleep.One of the first people infected is Tucker (Jeremy Northam), a CDC director investigating the crash. Once he is overcome, Tucker uses the CDC to spread the disease further, disguising the spores as flu inoculations. In a panic from a made-up \"flu bug,\" people rush to get \"inoculated,\" later becoming pod people when they sleep that night.Tucker's ex-wife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), knows something is amiss and, after locating several patients who say their loved ones are \"imposters,\" teams up with love interest and fellow doctor Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) to uncover what is really going on.With the help of Ben's friend Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), a biologist, they find out about the spore and discover that it takes over the brain during REM sleep. They also find out that people who have suffered diseases that affect the makeup of the brain, such as syphilis or ADEM, are immune to the spore because their previous diseases prevent the spore from \"latching on\" to the brain matter. Carol's son Oliver (Jackson Bond) is immune to the spore because of scarlet fever-type symptoms he had as a young child. Also seen immune is one of Carol's patients, Wendy Lenk, who escaped to her sister's house. On her way to her office, Carol sees several people crying and distraught and a homeless man having some sort of fit. When she gets to her office, Carol remembers what Wendy said about her husband not being her husband and searches on the Internet for similar responses. Suddenly, her secretary (infected) makes her favorite tea and infects it to spread the disease to her. Carol is about to drink the tea but receives a call from Ben and she...\nThe answer is: [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281637.7669175, "end": 1703281639.60271, "TT_ack": 13.68260383605957, "TTFT": 321.9618797302246, "TPOT": 33.12927159396085, "response_time": 1.8357925415039062, "output_tokens": 56, "worker_id": 10, "input_tokens": 111, "response_string": "\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>\n\nYou are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \"squalor and slovenly disorder\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \"one of the finest collections in the world\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \"garden rooms\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \"garden rooms\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by Sir John Baker. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker's fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the Seven Years' War.

The GazeGroup has been developing eye-controlled computer technology   for nearly 20 years. But those devices   have been mainly designed to aid those with disabilities, and are very expensive. \"After a while, we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market approach,\" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen, \"where everybody would have this available.\" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company, The Eye Tribe, which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works by sending an infrared   light from the computing device toward the user's face. After measuring the user's eye movements, the technology is then able to easily know where a person's eyes are moving, allowing the eyes to control a cursor  . A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at. There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world. Following Nintendo's popular Wii system, Xbox released the Kinect device, which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands, legs and voices.  Since most smartphones and other mobile devices can't come standard with an infrared device, Johansen said a replaceable filter   would be an inexpensive, convenient choice for most consumers. And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create a commercially practical product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for disabled users. \"Then I can go to any computer, and then I can control it and I can use it, instead of just bringing my own,\" said Stig Langvad, who heads up Denmark's umbrella organization for people with disabilities. \"So I'll be a part of society on an equal foot, instead of...

A member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, she won three singles championships in Grand Slam tournaments, was the gold medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics, reached the World No. 1 ranking, and is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Capriati set a number of youngest-ever records at the start of her career. She made her professional debut in 1990 at the age of 13 years 11 months, reaching the final of the hard-court tournament in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nShe won the Junior Orange Bowl in both the 12- and the 14-year categories, and is one of only nine tennis players to win the Junior Orange Bowl championship twice in its 70-year history, which list includes Andy Murray, Jimmy Connors, Monica Seles, and Yishai Oliel.  Capriati made her professional debut as a 13-year-old, reaching the finals of two of her first three pro events, losing to Gabriela Sabatini and Martina Navratilova in the Boca Raton and Hilton Head tournaments respectively, earning her first two wins over top-10 players (No. 10 Helena Sukova and number-five Arantxa Sanchez Vicario). She entered the rankings in April, at No. 23. Capriati made her Grand Slam debut at the French Open. She went all the way to the semifinals, losing to eventual champion Monica Seles. She then reached the fourth round at Wimbledon, losing to Steffi Graf. Later in the year Capriati won her first career title in Puerto Rico, defeating Zina Garrison. After this victory Capriati entered the world's top 10. She qualified for the WTA Championships, narrowly losing to Graf in the first round in three sets. She finished her first season as a professional at World Number Eight.  Throughout the season Capriati set multiple \"youngest ever\" records. She was the youngest player to reach a tour final, the youngest player to reach the semifinals at the French Open, the youngest seed ever at Wimbledon, and the youngest player to qualify for the season-ending championships. She was also the fourth-youngest player to win a WTA title.  In her second season as a touring pro, Capriati established herself as a consistent top-10 player. She won two singles titles during the summer hard court circuit, defeating World No. 1 Monica Seles in a third set tie-breaker in finals of San Diego, and Katerina Maleeva in straight sets in the final of Toronto. She also reached two Grand Slam semifinals, at Wimbledon and the US Open. At Wimbledon, the 15-year-old Capriati stunned nine-time champion Martina Navratilova, defeating her in the quarterfinals in straight sets. Capriati became the youngest person to ever reach the semifinal round of the tournament, losing to Sabatini. At the US Open, Capriati defeated Sabatini in the quarters but lost in the semis to eventual champion Seles after serving for the match twice. Capriati qualified for the year-end championships for the second time, reaching the quarterfinals. She ended the year at No. 6, which would be a career high until 2001.  Capriati also won the only doubles title of her career at the Italian Open, partnering with Seles.\n\nWho did she beat in 1999?

She said: 'I was just parking up in my garage when I realised I was still a bit close to the entrance and the door wouldn't shut so I needed to edge back just about six inches. 'But instead of being six inches it ended up being more like six metres.

'Then the car was just teetering on the wall - it's only small so I thought I'd be able to get out.

Margaret was treated by a paramedic at the scene and is recovering at home but is hoping to have her car back, with new brakes and an exhaust, by the end of the week. Dave Clark, Highgate Fire crew manager, said: 'On arrival West Midlands Ambulance had managed to lift her down from the car. 'It appeared as though the lady had reversed out her garage, and her foot had become jammed on the accelerator. 'Fortunately a tree had prevented the car from falling over the edge. The crew then winched the car to safety.' 'The woman was doing fine, though of course it was a bit of a shock.

Christmas has always been an exceptional time of love and tradition in the small town of Trapper Falls, Alaska. Hometown of Mayor Dan Reed looks forward to each year with enthusiasm to all the events, friends and family that fill this special season. Together with his brother Greg, they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright, a mean-spirited and embittered militant atheist returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious. Mitch is a highly successful big city lawyer who has never wanted anything to do with Trapper Falls. The rivalry re-ignites when the frustrated Mitch takes offense to what he sees as the town's violation of his rights. Mitch wants the Nativity scene removed from the front of City hall and the word Christmas switched to Happy Holidays on all signs. Fifty years of tradition are now challenged not by an outsider, but a former member of the community. As the conflict escalates, it goes beyond one person's opinion but magnifies into an entire town problem when Mitch enters into the mayoral race to have Dan replaced. In the heat of the legal battle and facing certain defeat, Dan's wife Kristen and their daughter Makayla, wanting to show what she believes to be the true meaning of Christmas, are inspired to launch a \"Christmas with a Capital C\" campaign as an effort to keep the town together. In doing so they discover the secret behind Mitch's return: he is looking for love and acceptance, but can't find it in the world of high-flown success.\nA: [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281621.4821067, "end": 1703281627.7178702, "TT_ack": 21.0723876953125, "TTFT": 269.38915252685547, "TPOT": 27.2574173776727, "response_time": 6.2357635498046875, "output_tokens": 229, "worker_id": 15, "input_tokens": 793, "response_string": "\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>\n\nYou are an AI assistant.

A 67-year-old woman in Clairemont, California, found herself going for an unexpected swim when she drove her SUV into a backyard pool. At around 2:40 p.m. Janet Walter drove her black 2010 Subaru sports utility vehicle through her garage and two fences, before driving the vehicle into her neighbor's pool. The driver was able to get herself out of the car without help, and only had minor injuries which were later treated on the scene. After the crash, Walter refused to talk to the media. Family members told ABC 10 News that the driver's only injury was a cut on her finger. Parking pool: A California woman crashed her SUV into a neighbor's backyard pool. Family members say her only injury was a cut on the finger. The driver's neighbor, Lynn Lynn, heard the crash and ran to the scene along with other neighbors. 'We all ran over there and got into the backyard behind and I kept yelling for her and I could hear her,' Lynn told Fox 5 San Diego. 'I didn't realize that she had kept going into the pool.' Lynn told reporters that the driver may have accidentally stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake. 'I heard her tell the officer that she stepped on the brake, but it kept going,' Lynn told CBS 8. The driver's son-in-law says that it was the woman's recent knee replacement that affected her ability to control the vehicle. Trick knee: Walter's son-in-law said that her recent knee-surgery affected her ability to control the vehicle. Surprise swim: Responding fire-fighters were surprised by how together Walter was after the accident - only sustaining minor injuries. Responding fire fighters were surprised she wasn't hurt. 'She seemed, for the circumstances, she seemed pretty together,' San Diego Fire Department Captain Sean Murphy told 10 News. 'She just seemed understandably shook up.' About two hours later, a San Diego towing company was able to pull the vehicle out of the pool. Rafael Quezaea, who was tasked with towing the vehicle out, said it was a difficult task. 'We don't really see this type of work everyday, but we have to figure it out,' Quezaea told Fox 5. Quezaea said they did their best to minimize damage to the pool. 'You just have to play with the cables,' Quezaea said. 'Play with the cables and the cables are going to move the car around that's what it is. We just work as we go.' The pool did incur some damage, but is covered by insurance. The only victims of the crash seemed to be a submerged cellphone and a water-damaged Sudoku book.

Movie plot title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey then pledges his devotion:\"I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world and by...\nThe answer is: [/INST]"}, {"start": 1703281631.4119346, "end": 1703281654.8096256, "TT_ack": 12.292623519897461, "TTFT": 380.173921585083, "TPOT": 27.707817995152766, "response_time": 23.397691011428833, "output_tokens": 845, "worker_id": 15, "input_tokens": 137, "response_string": "\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST]\n\n[/SYS]\n\n[/INST", "input_string": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Lost and Delirious Movie plot: When shy and introspective Mary arrives as a new freshman student at an all-girls boarding school, she shares a dorm room with two seniors, Pauline (nicknamed Paulie) and Victoria (nicknamed Tori). In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \"Mary Brave\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori's rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. When the three are jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents. While Paulie tends to the orphaned falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys' school. One of the boys, Jake Hollander (Luke Kirby), flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother's 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy's interest in her, saying, \"He liked my tits.\" When Mary asks if she'll go to the party, Tori says, \"And have all those gross guys groping me? No, thanks. I'd rather stay home and do math.\" Over time, Paulie and Tori become more...\n [/INST]\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If your undergraduate university does not offer such an option, begin looking for ASEP accredited MS programs that suit your needs.  When you find the right program, apply right away, Once you are accepted, spend 1-3 years completing your degree. Depending on your program, you may need to write a research report or thesis to finish. A PhD in exercise physiology (kinesiology) will be a research-heavy program. Like an MS program, you will continue to study the science of exercise and nutrition. However, as a PhD student, you will be expected to conduct research and contribute new knowledge to the field. In order to complete your degree, you will need to research and write a doctoral dissertation. If you know you would like to complete a Ph.D., look for an MS program that will prepare you for a Ph.D., or better yet, an MS program that leads directly into a PhD program.  Begin applying to PhD programs during your final year of your MS. Once you are accepted, spent 3-5 years (or more) pursuing your PhD. Make sure that any program you choose is ASEP certified. Many MS and PhD programs in exercise physiology will offer assistantships to students. This means that graduate students may complete teaching, research, or other types of work in exchange for a tuition waver. Beyond simply making graduate school more affordable for students, this hands-on professional training is excellent for students of exercise physiology at any level.

He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times.\n\nMickelson's first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an 18-foot (5.5 m) birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the \"majors monkey\" off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major, the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner is natural southpaw Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014.  Just prior to the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing contract with Titleist/Acushnet Golf, when he took heat for a voicemail message he left for a Callaway Golf executive. In it he praised their driver and golf ball, and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1-3-0 record, but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance.  In November 2004, Mickelson tallied his career-low for an 18-hole round: a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Hawaii.  The following year, Mickelson captured his second major at the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion that had been forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within a 18 inches (460 mm) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn.  Mickelson captured his third major title the following spring at the Masters. He won his second green jacket after shooting a 3-under-par final round, winning by two strokes over runner-up Tim Clark. This win propelled him to 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking (his career best), behind Woods, and ahead of Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen.\n\nAsk a question about this article.

Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \"enhance\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.

A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what it was before the calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict in the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism. Collectively these events are sometimes called the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages. \n\nDespite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress in the arts and sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the Renaissance of the 12th century through contact with Arabs during the Crusades, but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy.\n\nAnswer this series of questions:\n\n1.

It is an aerial apparatus commonly found in circus performances. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act. It is officially the last performance of the circus.  - A circus is a company of performers that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, unicyclists, as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s.  - In America , a sideshow is an extra , secondary production associated with a circus , carnival , fair or other such attraction .  - Object manipulation is a form of dexterity play or performance in which one or more people physically interact with one or more objects. Many object manipulation skills are recognised circus skills. Other object manipulation skills are linked to sport, magic, and everyday objects or practices. Many object manipulation skills use special props made for that purpose: examples include the varied circus props such as balls, clubs, hoops, rings, poi, staff, and devil sticks; magic props such as cards and coins; sports equipment such as nunchaku and footballs. Any other object can also be used for manipulation skills. Object manipulation with ordinary items may be considered to be object manipulation when the object is used out of its socially acknowledged context and used differently from its original purpose.  - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among:  - Philip Astley (8 January 1742  27 January 1814) was an English equestrian, circus owner, and inventor, regarded as being the \"father of the modern circus\". The circus industry, as a presenter of an integrated entertainment experience that includes music, domesticated animals, acrobats, and clowns, traces its heritage to Astley's Amphitheatre, a riding school that Astley founded in London following the success of his invention of the circus ring in 1768.  - Clowns are comic performers who employ slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.  - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks.

Delano was elected U.S. Congressman from Ohio, serving two full terms and one partial one. Prior to the American Civil War, Delano was a National Republican and then a Whig; as a Whig he was identified with the faction of the party that opposed the spread of slavery into the Western territories, and he became a Republican when the party was founded as the major anti-slavery party after the demise of the Whigs in the 1850s. During Reconstruction Delano advocated federal protection of African-Americans civil rights, and argued that the former Confederate states should be administered by the federal government, but were not part of the United States until they met the requirements for readmission to the Union.\nContext: In 1875, Delano's reputation for personal honesty came under increasing scrutiny as revelations of corruption in the Grant administration continued to be the subject of investigations and media revelations. Westerners unhappy with Delano's rulings on land grants and other issues accused Delano's son John, an employee of the Interior Department, of corruption, bribery, and fraud. Governor Edward M. McCook of the Colorado Territory, claimed that John Delano had accepted a $1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, to secure land patents from the Department of Interior.  The New-York Tribune reported that John Delano was profiteering through Interior's Office of the Surveyor General by accepting partnerships in Wyoming surveying contracts without having been trained in surveying or map making, and without providing any meaningful contribution to the fulfillment of the contracts; the obvious implication was John Delano had taken extortion money from illicit contract agreements. In March 1875, the former chief clerk of the Surveyor's Office, L. C. Stevens, wrote to Benjamin Bristow, Grant's Secretary of the Treasury, stating that Surveyor General Silas Reed had made several corrupt contracts which financially benefited John Delano. Stevens also said both Reed and John Delano had blackmailed five deputy surveyors for $5,000. More damaging was Stevens' charge that Columbus Delano knew and approved of what Reed had done for John Delano.  Both Bristow and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish demanded that Grant fire Delano.

Grant declined, telling Fish, \"If Delano were now to resign, it would be retreating under fire and be accepted as an admission of the charges.\" The controversy did not abate; by mid-August it became clear that Delano could not remain in office; Delano offered his resignation and Grant accepted, but Grant did not make it public. Grant finally announced his acceptance of Delano's resignation on October 19, 1875, after Bristow threatened to resign if Delano was not replaced. Grant replaced Delano with Zachariah Chandler, who quickly initiated civil service and other reforms in the Department of the Interior. Delano's administration was investigated by Congress, Chandler, and a special presidential commission; his personal conduct was exonerated, but his reputation as an honest, capable administrator was damaged, and Delano never again ran for office or served in an appointed one. In April 1876, The Committee on the Expeditures in the Interior Department confirmed that Reed had set up an illicit slush fund for John Delano's financial benefit, and that Delano thanked Reed while also telling him \"to be careful to do nothing that would have the semblance of wrong.\"\nQuestion: what was the corruption?.
